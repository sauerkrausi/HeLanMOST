## Abstract
Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) encompass ~50 monogenic disorders characterized by lysosomal accumulation. We developed a nanoflow-based multiomic single-shot technology (nMOST) to quantify proteomes and lipidomes from >24 LSD mutants in HeLa cells. Cross-correlation of lipidâ€“protein data revealed autophagic trafficking defects, ironâ€“lipid metabolism disruptions, and mitochondrial dysfunctionâ€”particularly in cholesterol-accumulating NPC1/2 mutants. These defects were partially rescued via transferrin-mediated iron delivery. This study demonstrates the power of nMOST for high-resolution phenotyping across LSDs.
